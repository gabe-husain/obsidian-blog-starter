# About This Site

Yo, welcome to my little corner of the internet. This site is built using a stack I've put together to turn [[Obsidian]] vaults into actual websites that people can browse through. Why? Because I think more people should be sharing their thoughts online, and the barriers to doing that should be lower.

## What's Going On Here?

This whole site is basically running on the idea that good note-taking is just organized thinking made visible. I use the [[Zettelkasten-Setup|Zettelkasten method]] for my own notes, and this site is built to support that kind of interconnected thinking.

## Why Build This?

Look, we've all got thoughts bouncing around in our heads. Some of us write them down in neat little systems, others just let them float away. I built this because I wanted a way to:

1. Share my notes without having to rewrite everything
2. Keep the connections between ideas intact
3. Make it easy for others to do the same

## Tech Stack

For the nerds in the back:
- Next.js because it's fast and flexible
- MDX for the markdown magic
- Tailwind because writing CSS by hand is for masochists
- Some custom parsing to handle Obsidian-style links

Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/yourusername/obsidian-blog-starter) if you want to see how it all works or use it yourself.

## Getting Started

If you're new here, check out the [[Zettelkasten Setup]] page to learn about how I organize my notes, or hop over to [[Fun With Notes]] to see some of the cool stuff you can do with this system.

Remember: this isn't just a blog template - it's a way to think out loud and share those thoughts with others. Use it however works best for you.
