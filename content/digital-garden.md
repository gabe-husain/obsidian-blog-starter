# Digital Gardening with Obsidian

A [[digital-garden]] is a different approach to blogging and note-taking. Unlike traditional blogs with chronological posts, digital gardens are interconnected webs of knowledge that grow over time.

## Key Concepts

## Connection to [[getting-started|Getting Started]]

As mentioned in the [[getting-started]] guide, Obsidian's features make it perfect for digital gardening:

1. **Wiki-style Links**: Create natural connections between ideas
2. **Backlinks**: See what references your current note
3. **Graph View**: Visualize your knowledge network

## Examples

> - Tags for additional organization

### Common Patterns

| Pattern | Purpose |
